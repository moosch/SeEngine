# SeEngine - Vulkan Tutorial

## Whta's it about?

Setting up Vulkan by going through the [Vulkan Hello World Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Introduction), but using C rather than C++.

## What it's not about

* Building a game engine (despite the name ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯)
* A tutorial on how to set up Vulkan
* Not a C tutorial - I'm pretty new to C

## Tools

* C language (likely C17)
* GCC & Make to build
* Vulkan SDK from [LunarG](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/)
* [GLFW](https://glfw.org) for window creation
* [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com) and/or [kDevelop](https://www.kdevelop.org) for debugging
* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
* Linux
